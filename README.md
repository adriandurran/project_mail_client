# Project Mail Client

Ok! I know I am not the only one but I loved Google Inbox. More to the point I detest the Gmail client. It is just horrible in so many ways.

I was happy with Google Inbox. And in typical Google fashion....they take something good and...get rid of it grrrrrr....

After a week of two grinding through Gmail I have had enough! So I thought I would have a play and see what I could come up with (wishing I had taken some screenshots).
